# datapulse-kafka-pipeline
This project implements a real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka, Python's psutil library for metric collection, and SQL Server for data storage. The pipeline collects metrics data from the local computer, processes it through Kafka brokers, and loads it into a SQL Server database. Additionally, a real-time dashboard is created using Power BI.
